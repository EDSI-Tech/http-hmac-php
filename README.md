# HMAC Request Signer

A PHP library that signs HTTP requests using a HMAC digest. The algorithm is
heavily inspired by [Amazon Web Service's](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html)
implementation and derived from the HMAC authentication system developed for
[Acquia Search](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-network/cloud-services/acquia-search).

The goal of this project is to generate a digest from common HTTP request
objects, e.g. [Guzzle](http://api.guzzlephp.org/class-Guzzle.Http.Message.Request.html)
and [Symfony](http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Request.html),
so that it can be reused in client-side and server-side implementations.

The following pseudocode illustrates the construction of the Authorization
header and signature.

```
Authorization = "Provider" + " " + ID + ":" + Signature;

Signature = Base64( HMAC-SHA1 )( SecretKey, Message ) );

Message =
    HTTP-Verb + "\n" +
	MD5( Request-Body ) + "\n" +
	Content-Type + "\n" +
	Date + "\n" +
    Custom-Headers + "\n"
	Resource
;
```

#### Authorization Header

The value of the `Authorization` header contains the following parts:

* `Provider`: The provider, for example "Acquia"
* `ID`: The API key's unique identifier, such as the one generated by [API Key Manager](https://github.com/acquia/api-key-manager)
* `Signature`: The base64 encoded HMAC digest as described below

#### Signature

The signature is a base64 encoded binary HMAC digest generated from the
following parts:

* `SecretKey`: The API key's shared secret, such as the one generated by [API Key Manager](https://github.com/acquia/api-key-manager)
* `Message`: The string being signed as described below

#### Message

The message is a concatenated string  generated from the following parts:

* `HTTP-Verb`: The uppercase HTTP request method e.g. "GET", "POST"
* `Request-Body`: The raw body of the HTTP request
* `Content-Type`: The lowercase value of the "Content-type" header
  * Note that in the message, the body is hashed using the MD5 algorithm
* `Date`: The value of the "Date" header
  * Can be configured to read the timestamp from a custom header, e.g. `x-acquia-timestamp`
* `Custom-Headers`: A canonicalized concatenation of specified custom headers
  * Each header is in `x-custom-header: value` format
  * Header names are lowercase
  * Headers with multiple multiple values are separated by a comma and space, e.g. `value1, value2`
  * Each header is separated by a newline in the concatenated string
* `Resource`: The HTTP request path + query string, e.g. `/resource?key=value`

## Installation

HMAC Request can be installed with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)
by adding it as a dependency to your project's composer.json file.

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/acquia/hmac-request"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "acquia/hmac-request": "*"
    }
}
```

Please refer to [Composer's documentation](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/doc/00-intro.md#introduction)
for more detailed installation and usage instructions.

## Usage

Sign an API request sent via Guzzle.

```php

use Acquia\Hmac\Guzzle3\HmacAuthPlugin;
use Acquia\Hmac\RequestSigner;
use Guzzle\Http\Client;

$requestSigner = new RequestSigner();
$plugin = new HmacAuthPlugin($requestSigner, 'apiKeyId', 'secretKey');

$client = new Client('http://example.com');
$client->addSubscriber($plugin);

$client->get('/resource')->send();

```

Authenticate the request in a Symfony-powered app e.g. [Silex](https://github.com/silexphp/Silex).

```php

use Acquia\Hmac\RequestAuthenticator;
use Acquia\Hmac\RequestSigner;
use Acquia\Hmac\Request\Symfony as RequestWrapper;

// $request is a \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request object.
$requestWrapper = new RequestWrapper($request);

// $keyLoader implements \Acquia\Hmac\KeyLoaderInterface

$authenticator = new RequestAuthenticator(new RequestSigner(), '+15 minutes');
$key = $authenticator->authenticate($requestWrapper, $keyLoader);

```

## Attribution

The techniques in this library were adapted from the work done by Peter Wolanin,
Jacob Singh, and Nick Veenhof for the [Acquia Search](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-network/cloud-services/acquia-search)
project.
